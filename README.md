  <summary><h2>Requirements for this book</summary>
   <p>This book does not assume specific database knowledge, but it will defi nitely help to have some basic familiarity with data itself. We’ll cover the foundational principles fi rst, and while it may be tempting to skip the fi rst chapter, please don’t! We’ll lay a foundation of terminology and explore the paradigm that will be used throughout the remainder of the book. </p>
   <p>You’ll be able to follow along with many of the examples in the book using Tableau Desktop and Tableau Prep Builder (in Chapter 15, Taming Data with Tableau Prep).</p> 
   <p>Most examples can be completed with almost any recent version of Tableau. New features and interfaces will require version 2025.1 or later. To use Tableau Agent as described in Chapter 17, AI Assisted Analysis: Tableau Agent and Tableau Pulse, you will need to speak with a Tableau representative about a Tableau+ license or trial.</p>

   <p>You may download and install the most recent versions from Tableau using these links:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>Tableau Desktop: https://www.tableau.com/products/desktop/download</li>
    <li>Tableau Prep Builder: https://www.tableau.com/products/prep/download </li>
   </ul>
   <p>Please speak to a Tableau representative for specifi c licensing information. In most cases, you may install a 14-day trial of each product if you do not currently have a license.</p>
